stock picker
============

A little script I am using to help pick stocks

usage
-----
Do something like:

    python stocks.py MO

To get some information on a single stock.

Or you can do something like:

    python stocks.py AAPL GOOG KR GE F T

To get info on several.  Neat.

Or, to pull the S&P 500 automatically and run our analysis on all of them:

    python stocks.py 500
